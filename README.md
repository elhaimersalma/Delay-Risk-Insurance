# Assurance de Risque Retard

## Description
This project aims to address the recurring issue of delays in the railway network by providing a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The application ensures automated, transparent, and reliable compensation for users impacted by service delays, eliminating bureaucracy and inefficiencies in traditional systems.

## Key Features
- **Automated Compensation:** Smart contracts handle the compensation process without human intervention.
- **Transparency:** Blockchain technology guarantees traceability and prevents data tampering.
- **Simplified Claims Process:** A user-friendly interface allows passengers to easily file and manage delay claims.

---

## Functional Overview
1. **User Registration and Management:**
   - Users create accounts via the DApp and register train services with details such as ID, departure/arrival times, and delay claims.

2. **Delay Evaluation:**
   - Smart contracts evaluate delays against predefined thresholds.

3. **Automated Payments:**
   - If the delay exceeds the threshold, the smart contract triggers a payment in Ether to the user's wallet.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Users can track their claims, payment statuses, and service history via dashboards.

5. **Administrative Controls:**
   - Administrators can update delay thresholds and compensation rules as required.

- **Programming Language:** Solidity
- **Frontend:** React
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js
- **Crypto Wallet Integration:** MetaMask

## Architecture
1. **Frontend:**
   - User interface for passengers and administrators.

2. **Backend:**
   - Ethereum smart contracts for processing claims and managing compensation.

3. **Blockchain:**
   - Immutable ledger for storing service and transaction data.
